INTRODUCTION TO NODE.JS

BASIC HTTP SERVER USING NODE.JS

In this practical, we created a simple web server using Node.js' built-in http module.
We used createServer() to handle requests and send responses.
The server listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) and port 3000.
When someone accesses the server, it responds with "Hello Node JS" in plain text.

SETTING UP A SERVER USING EXPRESS.JS

Express.js is built on top of Node.js' http module but provides a simpler and more efficient way to handle web servers

In this practical, we created a simple web server using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework.
We installed Express.js using npm install express.
We created an Express server that listens on port 3001.
The server responds with "Hello Express JS" when accessed from a browser.
